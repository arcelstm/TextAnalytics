2016, more so than any other year before, is quickly being positioned as the year of virtual reality.With Samsung’s Gear VR already available and both HTC Vive VR and Oculus Rift – the device that single-handedly revived hopes of a virtual reality future – due on shelves over the next few months, expectations for the technology to finally prove itself are rising.But the backlash to Oculus Rift’s £500 price tag has highlighted lingering division across the industry as to whether VR really is the be-all-and-end-all that countless tech demos and hefty investments have led us to believe.Shahid Ahmad, indie developer and former head of strategic content at SCEE, believes it will be the launch titles for Oculus, Vive and PlayStation VR that give us the first true glimpse into the tech’s future.“It’s essential that the first experiences in this new medium are positive and captivating,” he tells Develop. “Day one experiences need to be safe, but thrilling enough to persuade customers that VR is worth the investment. “Every day one title is responsible for making a statement about what VR is. You want lots of developers to embrace the tech, but you only want to showcase those games that make VR look great.”Expectations for VR are so high I fear nothing short of an Apple-sized success will assuage the accountants.VR creator Sólfar Studios, warns that devs need to hold themselves to a higher standard when it comes to creating early VR titles.“If anything expectations aren’t high enough – at least, on the creative side,” he says. “As an industry, we run the risk of underestimating how radically VR will shift player perceptions if we get the initial conditions right in year one.”NDreams CEO Patrick O’Luanaigh adds: “I’m convinced that VR is going to be successful, but it is going to take a while. It seems natural that VR will see primary adoption by gamers, but you can expect it to spread into education, training, and many other industries in relatively short order – certainly within the next few years. “With so many huge companies and investors behind VR, and such a great reaction to it from the public when they experience quality VR first-hand, it can only be just the beginning of something very exciting.”
