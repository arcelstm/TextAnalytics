 It also says the Spanish captain in charge used an ingenious tactic to prevent his tiny fleet from being separated and picked off: he tied his ships together with chains, end to end, in such a way as to prevent any glaring blind spots.
Really, this battle highlights how superior tactics and strategy can beat out superior numbers, but this was by no means 'normal' - the Spanish leader was particularly bold about this plan and wanted to go back to Sicily with a great victory.
The Spanish also had at least a thousand musketeers aboard their five ships, which greatly helped them fend off the Ottoman galleys and the Janiserries trying to board them.
